# gulp-build

## Intructions to run

> Install dev dependancies

```sh
npm install --save-dev
```
> Gulp everything!

```sh
gulp
```

> Note: this projects is using [gulp-eslint](https://github.com/adametry/gulp-eslint) for linting and following the airbnb styleguide. The build process will thow errors since the project JS does not follow the style guide. I programmed gulpfile.js to not stop the build process upon throwing errors.
